# View Implementation Plan: My Flashcards

## 1. Overview

The "My Flashcards" view is a central hub for users to manage their flashcards. It provides functionalities for viewing a paginated list of all their flashcards, creating new ones manually, editing existing ones, and deleting them. The user interface is designed to be intuitive, with modals for creation/editing to ensure a smooth experience without page reloads, and includes confirmation steps for critical actions like deletion.

## 2. View Routing

- **Path**: `/flashcards`
- **Accessibility**: This view should be protected and accessible only to authenticated users.

## 3. Component Structure

The view will be composed of a main page component that orchestrates data fetching and state management, and several child components for UI and interaction.
