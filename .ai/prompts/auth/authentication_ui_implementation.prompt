Your task is to implement user interface elements (pages and forms) for the login, registration, and account recovery process. The specification is located in: @auth-spec.md

Remember the assumptions @astro.mdc and @react.mdc -

Use similar styling to {{EXISTING_COMPONENTS}}

Do not implement backend or application state modifications - we will deal with these elements in the next steps
