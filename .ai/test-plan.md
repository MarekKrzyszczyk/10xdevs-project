# Test Plan: 10xCards Application

## 1. Introduction and Testing Objectives

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the **10xCards** application. The primary objective is to ensure the application's quality, reliability, functionality, and performance before deployment. This plan details the scope, types of tests, required resources, and schedule to validate that the application meets all specified requirements.

### Key Objectives:
- **Functionality:** Verify that all features, including user authentication, flashcard management (CRUD), and AI-powered content generation, work as expected.
- **Reliability:** Ensure the application is stable and provides a consistent user experience across different scenarios.
- **Usability:** Validate that the user interface is intuitive, accessible, and easy to navigate.
- **Performance:** Confirm the application is responsive and performs efficiently under expected load.
- **Security:** Ensure that user data is secure and that the application is protected against common vulnerabilities.

## 2. Scope of Testing

### In-Scope Features:
- **User Authentication:** Registration, login, logout, and session management.
- **Flashcard Management:** Creating, reading, updating, and deleting flashcards and flashcard sets.
- **API Endpoints:** All backend endpoints located in `src/pages/api/`, especially those related to flashcards.
- **AI Integration:** Functionality related to OpenRouter.ai for content generation.
- **Frontend Components:** All interactive React components, including forms, dialogs, and navigation.
- **Database Integrity:** Validation of data consistency and correctness in the Supabase PostgreSQL database.
- **Responsive Design:** UI/UX consistency across major breakpoints (desktop, tablet, mobile).

### Out-of-Scope Features:
- Third-party infrastructure testing (e.g., Supabase or DigitalOcean service uptime).
- Comprehensive load testing beyond baseline performance checks.
- Testing of third-party libraries and packages themselves (only their integration will be tested).

## 3. Types of Tests

- **Unit Tests:** Focus on individual functions and React components in isolation. This will primarily target business logic in services (`flashcard.service.ts`), utility functions, and component rendering.
- **Integration Tests:** Verify the interactions between different parts of the application, such as API endpoints and the database, or frontend components and backend services.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Simulate real user scenarios from start to finish. These tests will cover critical user flows like signing up, creating a flashcard set, and studying it.
- **API Tests:** Directly test the API endpoints for correctness, error handling, and security.
- **Security Tests:** Focus on authentication, authorization (route protection), and input validation to prevent common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
- **Performance Tests:** Basic performance checks on page load times and API response times.
- **Usability & UI Tests:** Manual and automated checks to ensure the UI is consistent, accessible, and matches the design specifications.

## 4. Test Scenarios for Key Functionalities

### 4.1. User Authentication
- **TC-AUTH-01:** A new user can successfully register with a valid email and password.
- **TC-AUTH-02:** A registered user can successfully log in.
- **TC-AUTH-03:** A logged-in user can successfully log out.
- **TC-AUTH-04:** An unauthenticated user is redirected from protected routes (e.g., dashboard) to the login page.
- **TC-AUTH-05:** A user cannot log in with incorrect credentials.

### 4.2. Flashcard Management
- **TC-CARD-01:** A logged-in user can create a new set of flashcards.
- **TC-CARD-02:** A logged-in user can add a new flashcard to an existing set.
- **TC-CARD-03:** A logged-in user can view their flashcard sets.
- **TC-CARD-04:** A logged-in user can edit an existing flashcard.
- **TC-CARD-05:** A logged-in user can delete a flashcard or an entire set.

### 4.3. AI Integration
- **TC-AI-01:** Verify that the AI feature successfully generates flashcard content based on user input.
- **TC-AI-02:** Test the handling of errors from the OpenRouter.ai API (e.g., API key limit, server error).

## 5. Test Environment

- **Local Development:** Developers run unit and integration tests on their local machines.
- **Staging Environment:** A production-like environment hosted on DigitalOcean, connected to a separate Supabase test project. This environment will be used for E2E and manual QA testing.
- **Production Environment:** Final production deployment on DigitalOcean.

## 6. Testing Tools

- **Unit & Integration Testing:** **Vitest** with **React Testing Library**.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:** **Playwright** for automating browser interactions.
- **API Testing:** **Postman** or automated tests using `fetch` within Vitest.
- **CI/CD:** **GitHub Actions** to automate the execution of all test suites on every push and pull request.
- **Linting & Formatting:** **ESLint** and **Prettier** for static code analysis and maintaining code quality.

## 7. Test Schedule (High-Level)

- **Sprint-Based Testing:** Testing activities will be integrated into each development sprint.
- **Unit & Integration Tests:** Written continuously by developers alongside new features.
- **E2E & API Tests:** Developed and run towards the end of each sprint/milestone.
- **Regression Testing:** A full suite of automated tests will be run before each release to ensure no existing functionality has been broken.

## 8. Test Acceptance Criteria

### Entry Criteria:
- The feature is code-complete and deployed to the staging environment.
- All unit and integration tests are passing.

### Exit Criteria:
- 95% of all test cases are passed.
- No critical or high-priority bugs remain open.
- The full regression test suite passes.
- The application meets all functional and non-functional requirements.

## 9. Roles and Responsibilities

- **Developers:** Responsible for writing unit and integration tests for their code. Also responsible for fixing bugs found during testing.
- **QA Engineer (this role):** Responsible for creating and maintaining the test plan, developing E2E and API tests, performing manual testing, and managing the bug reporting process.
- **Product Manager:** Responsible for defining acceptance criteria and performing final user acceptance testing (UAT).

## 10. Bug Reporting Procedure

All bugs will be tracked using GitHub Issues. A bug report must include:
- **Title:** A clear and concise summary of the issue.
- **Description:** Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.
- **Expected Result:** What should have happened.
- **Actual Result:** What actually happened (include screenshots or logs).
- **Environment:** Where the bug was found (e.g., Staging, Browser version).
- **Priority:** Critical, High, Medium, Low.
